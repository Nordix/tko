TODO
====

* Archive previous versions of templates, sites, and deployments to allow for reverting
  changes
* Instantiation: keep track of deleted deployments per site
* If Placement uses a site selector, should we continuously track the selection? How?
* Parallel processing by multiple controller instances (sharding?)
* Support Spanner
* Support TOSCA ETSI NSDs
* Explore using [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) for log aggregation
